          <p>
            Our team aims to foster an environment that is readily accessible to
            students and provide a space for them to apply, strengthen, and hone
            their technical skills. We take pride in providing a very hands-on
            learning experience for all of our members, with support and
            guidance from senior leads. It is our utmost priority to ensure that
            our team members are equipped with the necessary skills to succeed
            both within and outside of the team. As such, we integrate many
            research opportunities into the team that pertain to our main tasks,
            as well as projects that are conducted under our collaboration with
            the Bionics Network at UBC.

            We are delighted to announce the recent addition of a brand new
            research team to the UBC Bionics Team. This research team will
            collaborate on a collection of smaller group projects with UBC
            professors and graduate students, that will help members develop
            skills to aid to the advancement of our current project, GRASP. For

        Currently, we have undertaken two main projects; our pilot project,
        GRASP, which is a smart bionic arm designed to enhance daily life for
        amputees. Recently, we have also initiated the design of a
        brain-computer interface, NERV. We hope to submit both of our projects
